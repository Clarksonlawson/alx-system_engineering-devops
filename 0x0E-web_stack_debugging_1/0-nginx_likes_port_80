 address the issue preventing Nginx from listening on port 80, we'll need to examine the configuration and ensure Nginx is properly set up. Here's a Bash script to automate the fix:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script configures Nginx to listen on port 80

# Ensure Nginx is installed
if ! dpkg -s nginx &> /dev/null; then
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y nginx
fi

# Check if Nginx is already configured to listen on port 80
if ! grep -q "listen 80;" /etc/nginx/sites-available/default; then
    # Configure Nginx to listen on port 80
    sed -i 's/listen 80 default_server;/listen 80;/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
fi

# Restart Nginx to apply changes
service nginx restart
```

This script first checks if Nginx is installed and installs it if not. Then, it verifies if Nginx is already configured to listen on port 80. If not, it modifies the configuration file to include the necessary directive. Finally, it restarts Nginx to apply the changes.

You can run this script on your server to ensure Nginx listens on port 80 as required.
